# Dev-Training

- This web-app is deployed via Netlify.
![Netlify](https://determined-hopper-0e021f.netlify.app/)

## Project Description

Dev-Training is an Airtable and React build where the user is able to leave a comment for several software development topics: HTML, CSS, JS. The homepage will offer three different paths on the Nav bar so the user can quickly get to the general topic populated with a feed of previously posted comments. Each page will have a form to create new comments. Users will be able to delete and edit this comment. 

## Wireframes

The wireframes below illustrate Dev-Training's responsiveness relative to monitor and phone formats. We will have each language's icon: HTML, CSS, JS; be clickable and will properly navigate to the appropriate feed.The comment feed has a form, submit button, and an edit button. As the screen size decreases the form and buttons will move to the center of the page. Regarding the homepage, the Nav Bar icons will change from horizontal to verticle.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:
- Positive attitude and a fundamental knowledge of the concepts and how the pieces of the puzzle fit
- Team Sapphire and the GA commnuity's resources: TA hours, issue tickets, and fellow Sapphires

### Weaknesses:
- Still gaining familiarity with handleSubmit, useState, and useEffect - so still mastering the content
- CSS and styling continues to be my achilles heel but may need to collaborate with another student

### Opportunities:
- Gain more hands-on experience with ReactReact
- Appreciate all of the insights (both small and large) that Sapphire has learned thus far and will continue to learn on the Dev path ahead

### Threats:
- The following are competing priorities that will threatened my dev time but I think we can plan around these:
- Behind on homework and still need to submit randoUser, Audobon, and Color Switcher (my average homework completion time is ~3 hours per)
- A 1 hour each pair of Dr. Appointments 
- A 3 hour board meeting
