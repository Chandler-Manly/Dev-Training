# Dev-Training

- This web-app is deployed via [Netlify](https://dev-training.netlify.app/).

## Project Description

Dev-Training is an Airtable and React build where the user is able to leave a comment for several software development topics: HTML, CSS, JS. The homepage will offer three different paths on the Nav bar so the user can quickly get to the general topic populated with a feed of previously posted comments. Each page will have a form to create new comments. Users will be able to delete and edit this comment. The following dependencies will need to be installed via npm install axios, react-router-dom.

## Wireframes

The wireframes below illustrate Dev-Training's responsiveness relative to monitor and phone formats. We will have each language's icon: HTML, CSS, JS; be clickable and will properly navigate to the appropriate feed.The comment feed has a form, submit button, and an edit button. As the screen size decreases the form and buttons will move to the center of the page. Regarding the homepage, the Nav Bar icons will change from horizontal to verticle.

## SWOT Analysis

### Strengths:
- Team Sapphire and the GA commnuity's resources: TA hours, issue tickets, and fellow Sapphires

### Weaknesses:
- Still gaining familiarity with handleSubmit, useState, and useEffect - so still mastering the content
- CSS and styling continues to be my achilles heel but may need to collaborate with another student

### Opportunities:
- Gain more hands-on experience with CRUD, JavaScript, and React framework

### Threats:
- User experience and design 

## Change Log
- Had to deviate from the original wireframe re parsing data by topic and changed concept to a general forum
- Within the form table I created a drop down list with the specific topics so each comment will be tagged and can be sorted when the team refactors this project
